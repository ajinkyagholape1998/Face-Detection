# Face-Detection
This repository contains console based & ui based python program file.
The program takes input as an image & processes it to find out faces from input image and display number of faces found in image
**Let's see an example**
This image is given to the program as input & output will be displayed as follows: 
<img align="left" width="400" height="400" src="https://github.com/ajinkyagholape1998/Face_Detection/blob/master/Face%20Detection%20Gui/lena.png">
<img width="400" height="400" src="https://github.com/ajinkyagholape1998/Face_Detection/blob/master/Face%20Detection%20Gui/lena_face.jpg">

**Let's see another example (gui)**

As we can see the above screen shot of window, contains two buttons, a scale and an image that shows the faces found surrounded by squere and count of facse(number of faces found in image) 

- **Browse Image** button is used to take an image from storage files, after this the processed image will be displayed.
- **Scale** using this scale we can adjust the scale factor.
- **Save Image** as name suggest this button is used to save the proccessed image at intended location in file.
